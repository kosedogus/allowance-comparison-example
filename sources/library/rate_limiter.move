/// A small, embeddable rate-limiting primitive for Sui.
///
/// `RateLimiter` is a plain `store + drop` value that integrators embed as a field inside
/// their own objects. There is no registry, no policy object, and no separate ID that
/// integrators must track and assert against: the limiter's scope is whatever object it
/// lives inside.
///
/// Three strategies are provided in one enum, all sharing the same API:
/// - `Bucket` - continuously refilling token bucket with a configurable refill schedule,
/// - `FixedWindow` - up to `capacity` units per fixed-length window anchored at a chosen start,
/// - `Cooldown` - up to `capacity` units before requiring a `cooldown_ms` wait.
///
/// Typical lifecycle:
/// 1. the integrator creates a limiter with one of the `new_*` constructors and stores it in
///    their own struct,
/// 2. hot paths call `consume_or_abort` or `try_consume`,
/// 3. read paths call `available` for inspection,
/// 4. when configuration or runtime state must change, the integrator constructs a fresh
///    `RateLimiter` with the desired field values (reading current state via `available`,
///    `capacity`, `window_start_ms`, `cooldown_end_ms`, etc.) and overwrites the field.
///
/// # Operator responsibilities
///
/// Configs only need positivity; the implementation handles internal overflow safety
/// without further upper bounds. One operator-side caveat: for `Cooldown`, the deadline
/// is computed as `now + cooldown_ms`. The Sui `Clock` is monotonic and bounded well
/// below `u64::MAX`, but `cooldown_ms` near `u64::MAX` would overflow this addition.
/// Operators must pick `cooldown_ms` such that `now + cooldown_ms` cannot overflow at
/// any plausible chain timestamp during the limiter's lifetime - any policy-meaningful
/// value (seconds to days to years in ms) satisfies this trivially.
///
/// Any function taking `&mut RateLimiter` mutates live state. Gate the entry functions
/// that expose them with whatever authorization model is appropriate for the call site
/// (`Cap`, `openzeppelin_access`, governance, multisig, ...). The module is agnostic.
///
/// # Reconfiguration
///
/// This module deliberately does not provide in-place reconfigure functions. To change a
/// limiter's configuration or runtime state, read the current state via the getters,
/// compute the desired new field values, construct a fresh `RateLimiter`, and overwrite
/// the field. Every reconfigure policy - preserve anchor, project then re-anchor, full
/// reset, proportional carry, freeze in-flight gate, etc. - is expressible in caller code.
/// The library validates structural invariants on construction; the choice of semantics is
/// entirely the integrator's.
///
/// # Upgrade compatibility
///
/// `RateLimiter` is a `public enum` embedded inside integrator-owned objects. Adding a new
/// variant or new fields to an existing variant in a future package upgrade is not a
/// binary-compatible change: any object that already stored a prior shape would fail to
/// deserialize. Future evolution must either preserve the current variant set and field
/// layouts, or ship as a parallel `RateLimiterV2` type with a migration path for integrators.
